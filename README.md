# Housing_Portal
The project “YouareonDefault” is a portal for a housing company which has apartments and buildings under  various subdivisions. Each subdivision has a “Subdivision Manager”. Each building has a “Building Manager”.  Each apartment has one “Apartment Owner”. While signing up on the website a user must choose their role between a Subdivision Manager, Building  Manager and Apartment Owner. One user can use only one email id for one role. The same email id cannot to  be used to sign up again in this website.
Apartment owners can keep track of their all types of bills and also they can compare with the previous monthly bills from the charts.
In the same way Building Manager can see all the data of all the apartment owners under that building and they have the conversation facility for any issues.
Subdivision Manager is kind os the community manager, he can access all the data across the community. He has facility to chat with either subdivision manager or apartment owners.
